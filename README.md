# unblock-survivio
This is a GitHub repo that uses an iframe to bypass a Chrome extension that blocks games and stuff. My fellow students are particulary fond of Surviv.io, but the extension blocked the websites for it. Some websites worked, but fullscreen didn't work.
<br>
The solution? Make something that can bypass it.
<br>

So I did.
